# Python Fundamentals: A 36-Hour Mastery Program

This repository contains all the code, notes, and project solutions for the **"Python Fundamentals Mastery Guide,"** a comprehensive, 36-hour introductory course designed to take learners from absolute zero to proficient Python programmers.

---

## 🎯 Course Goal and Focus

This program is built around the principle of **practical application**.
Our goal is not just theoretical knowledge, but the ability to write **clean, functional, and reusable Python code**.

The 36 hours are strategically divided to cover four main pillars:

1. **Foundation:** Setup, Variables, Data Types, and Operators.
2. **Structure:** Control Flow (if/elif/else), Lists, Tuples, and Sets.
3. **Automation:** Loops (for and while), Dictionaries, and Functions.
4. **Application:** Error Handling (try/except), File I/O, Modules, and an introduction to OOP.

## 📅 Course Structure (4 Weeks)

The curriculum is divided into **17 core sessions**, each ~2 hours long, structured for flexible, self-paced learning.

| Week       | Focus Area                | Key Concepts Covered                                                                                                     | Practice Project       |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Week 1** | Foundations               | Variables, Integers, Floats, Strings, Booleans, Arithmetic, User Input (`input()`), Formatted Output (f-Strings)         | Basic Calculator       |
| **Week 2** | Collections & Control     | Conditional Logic (if/elif/else), Lists (indexing, slicing, methods), Tuples (immutability), Sets (uniqueness, set math) | To-Do List Manager     |
| **Week 3** | Automation & Functions    | `for` Loops, `while` Loops, Dictionaries, Functions (`def`, `return`, parameters)                                        | Word Frequency Counter |
| **Week 4** | Reliability & Persistence | Error Handling (try/except), File I/O (`with open`), Modules (random, math), Intro to OOP (Classes & Objects)            | Contact Book           |

## 💬 Code Snippets and Clarity

Each session's code files are heavily commented to explain:

* The purpose of the code block
* The specific Python syntax being introduced
* Example usage and common scenarios
* Helpful notes (e.g., negative indexing, `range()`, `try/except` patterns)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**

You'll need:

* **Python 3.x** (download from python.org)
* **A Code Editor**: VS Code, PyCharm, or any modern editor with Python support

---

### **Setup Instructions**

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [repository_url_here]
cd python-fundamentals-mastery-program
```

Run a session file:

```bash
python variables_and_types.py
```

Start coding by opening any folder in your editor and following along with the study guide.

## 📝 Contribution

This is a **personal learning repository**, but if you find errors or want to suggest improvements:

* Open an **issue**
* Submit a **pull request**
